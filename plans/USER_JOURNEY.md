# USER JOURNEY: Crypto Market Dashboard

## Journey Stage 1: Discovery & Initial Exploration
**User Goal:** Get an immediate sense of live market activity and understand what data is available.

**Key Interactions:**
*   **Upon Landing:** The user is presented with a live-updating overview of cryptocurrency prices.
*   **Primary Action:** The user scans the **Asset Ticker** list to see which currencies are moving (up/down) and their current prices.
*   **System Response:** Prices and percentage changes update in real-time without user intervention. Visual cues (color, icons) instantly convey market direction.
*   **Deepening Exploration:** The user selects a specific asset (e.g., BTC) from the ticker to investigate further.
*   **Emotional Hook:** "The market is alive and moving right now. I can see what's happening at a glance."

## Journey Stage 2: Focused Analysis & Personalization
**User Goal:** Drill into a specific asset to understand its current trading context and save it for later tracking.

**Key Interactions:**
*   **After Selection:** The dashboard focuses on the chosen asset, revealing deeper data layers.
*   **Analyzing Depth:** The user examines the **Order Book** to see the current balance of buy and sell orders, understanding immediate support and resistance levels.
*   **Reviewing History:** The user views the **Price Chart** to see recent trends and historical context for the current price.
*   **Personalizing:** The user adds the asset to their **Watchlist** for persistent, easy access in future sessions.
*   **Setting a Live Alert:** The user defines a **Price Trigger** (e.g., "Notify me if price drops below X") for in-session monitoring.
*   **Emotional Hook:** "I can quickly go from a broad view to a detailed, personalized analysis of what matters to me."

## Journey Stage 3: Social & Collaborative Context
**User Goal:** Gauge community activity and sentiment around the asset or the platform itself.

**Key Interactions:**
*   **Checking Community Pulse:** The user notices the **Live Viewers** counter, understanding how many others are concurrently analyzing the market.
*   **Contributing Sentiment:** The user submits their own "Bullish" or "Bearish" vote via the **Market Sentiment** widget and sees the aggregated opinion of all current users update live.
*   **Receiving a Trigger Notification:** A visually distinct alert activates on the dashboard because the market price hit the user's predefined **Price Trigger** level.
*   **Emotional Hook:** "I'm not just looking at raw data; I'm participating in a live, shared market observation with clear signals for action."

## Journey Stage 4: Seamless Return & Continuity
**User Goal:** Resume their market watch efficiently in a subsequent session.

**Key Interactions:**
*   **Upon Returning:** The user's **Watchlist** is immediately visible and restored, prioritizing their preferred assets.
*   **Resuming Focus:** The user selects an asset from their watchlist, and the dashboard returns to their previous analytical context (chart, order book).
*   **Emotional Hook:** "The dashboard remembers what I care about, letting me pick up right where I left off."
